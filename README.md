# HelloESP8266

PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

This is a minimalistic project aimed to show the basic CMake setup steps required for programming ESP8266 chip.

Based on the `https://github.com/rzajac/esp-dev-env.git`

NOTE:
Now compiles!


HINT:
As long as here a esp-open-sdk is supposed to be inside a project tree, in CLion it should de excluded:
project_tree->esp-open-sdk->Mark Directory as->Excluded
that will speed-up indexing during each build
